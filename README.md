This repository contains several attemps at the Group Bimbo Inventory Demand competition hosted at Kaggle. Several techniques from Data Science and Machine Learning were used, for example:

**means.py** - naive algorithm using hierarchical groups of means.

**gbtree.R** - Regression trees trained via gradient boosting with the xgboost package.
